# CDN

CDN is a network of distributed servers that store and deliver web content (like images, CSS, JavaScript, videos) closer to users, reducing load times.
It helps improve the performance and availability of web content by caching it on servers located geographically closer to users.
CDN primarily focuses on efficiently delivering static content and assets.
