GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allows clients to request only the specific data they need from a server. Unlike traditional REST APIs, where the server determines the structure and content of the responses, GraphQL lets clients define their data requirements, which can reduce over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

In simpler terms, GraphQL provides a more flexible and efficient way for applications to communicate with servers by enabling clients to request exactly the data they require, resulting in more efficient and tailored data exchanges between the client and the server. It's particularly useful in situations where optimizing network performance or accommodating complex data requirements is crucial.

## IN SHORT 

GraphQL is a way for apps to talk to servers more efficiently. Instead of getting all data at once, apps can ask for only what they need. This saves time and makes apps run smoother.
