# What do you understand by aggregation inline?

Aggregation inline refers to a feature in MongoDB's aggregation framework that allows you to perform aggregation operations directly in the same document or collection where the data resides, without the need to create a separate output collection.

In simple terms, it's a way to aggregate, transform, or process data within MongoDB without necessarily creating a new collection to store the results. This can be useful for on-the-fly data manipulations and calculations within your existing data.
