 In Node.js, Bcrypt is a popular library used for securely hashing and salting passwords. It provides a way to store and verify user passwords in a way that makes it difficult for the attacker to reverse-engineer the original passwords, even if they gain access to the hashed values.

 Here's a simple explanation of what Bcrypt does:

1. Hashing: Bcrypt takes a plain-text password and transforms it into a long and seemingly random string of characters called a hash. This hash is unique to the original password.

2. Salting: Bcrypt also adds a random piece of data, called a "salt," to the password before hashing it.
This salt is unique for each user and adds an extra layer of security.

3. Security: By using Bcrypt, even if an attacker gets hold of the hashed passwords and the salt,it's extremely difficult and time-consuming for them to reverse-engineer the original passwords. This helps protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
```
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");

Hashing a password
const plainPassword = "mySecurePassword";
const saltRounds = 10; // Number of salt rounds (higher is more secure)
bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, saltRounds, (err, hash) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error hashing password:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("Hashed Password:", hash);
  }
});

Verifying a password
const hashedPassword = "$2b$10$..."; // Replace with the actual hash you previously generated
bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hashedPassword, (err, result) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error comparing passwords:", err);
  } else {
    if (result) {
      console.log("Password is correct!");
    } else {
      console.log("Password is incorrect.");
    }
  }
});
```
