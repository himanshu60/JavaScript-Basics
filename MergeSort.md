Merging Two Sorted Sublists in the Mergesort Algorithm

Introduction to Mergesort (2 minutes)

1. What is Mergesort?

Mergesort is a highly efficient and widely used sorting algorithm in computer science. It's a technique for arranging a list or an array of items into a specific order, typically from smallest to largest (ascending order).

Why is Mergesort Important?

Mergesort is essential because of its reliability and consistent performance. It employs a "divide and conquer" strategy, which means it breaks the sorting problem into smaller, more manageable pieces. This property makes Mergesort particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as it ensures a predictable and efficient sorting process.

Moreover, Mergesort guarantees a time complexity of O(n log n) for all cases, making it one of the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms available. Its stability and predictable performance make it a fundamental tool in various applications, from data processing to algorithm design.

2. Divide and Conquer (2 minutes):

Mergesort is smart because it breaks the big problem into smaller, easier-to-solve problems.
It takes a list and divides it into two smaller lists, over and over again, until each list has just one item.

Divide and Conquer is a problem-solving approach used in computer science and algorithms. It's based on breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems, solving them independently, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem.

3. Complexity Analysis (1 minute):

Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n log n) - Mergesort is consistently efficient, even for already sorted lists.
Average Case: O(n log n) - It performs well on average for random data.
Worst Case: O(n log n) - It guarantees this performance, making it reliable for large datasets.
Space Complexity: O(n) - Mergesort uses extra memory to merge sublists, which can be a concern for very large datasets.

Mergesort divides the problem into smaller subproblems and efficiently combines them, making it a reliable choice for sorting tasks.

4. Merging

List=[1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6]

Initial Lists:
[1, 3, 5]    [2, 4, 6]

Merged List:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
provide all step between initial to merge like that

Certainly, let's walk through the step-by-step implementation of merging two sorted lists without providing code. We'll start with the initial lists and illustrate how elements are merged to form the final merged list:

Step 1: Initial Lists

Lists to be merged:
List A: [1, 3, 5]
List B: [2, 4, 6]
Step 2: Comparison and Merging

Compare the first elements of both lists (List A and List B).
Take the smaller element (1) and add it to the merged list.
Move the pointer in List A to the next element (3).
Result: Merged List: [1]

List A: [3, 5]
List B: [2, 4, 6]

Step 3: Comparison and Merging (Continued)

Compare the first elements of both lists again.
Take the smaller element (2) and add it to the merged list.
Move the pointer in List B to the next element (4).
Result: Merged List: [1, 2]

List A: [3, 5]
List B: [4, 6]

Step 4: Comparison and Merging (Continued)

Compare the first elements of both lists.
Take the smaller element (3) and add it to the merged list.
Move the pointer in List A to the next element (5).
Result: Merged List: [1, 2, 3]

List A: [5]
List B: [4, 6]

Step 5: Comparison and Merging (Continued)

Compare the first elements of both lists.
Take the smaller element (4) and add it to the merged list.
Move the pointer in List B to the next element (6).
Result: Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4]

List A: [5]
List B: [6]

Step 6: Comparison and Merging (Continued)

Compare the first elements of both lists.
Take the smaller element (5) and add it to the merged list.
Move the pointer in List A to the next element (none remaining in List A).
Result: Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

List A: []
List B: [6]

Step 7: Appending Remaining Elements

Since List A is empty and List B still has elements, simply append the remaining elements from List B to the merged list.
Result: Merged List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

List A: []
List B: []

Step 8: Final Merged List

Both lists are now empty, and the merged list contains all elements in sorted order.
Step 9: Conclusion

The two sorted lists [1, 3, 5] and [2, 4, 6] have been successfully merged into the sorted list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
This step-by-step explanation illustrates how the merging process occurs, comparing elements from the initial lists and adding them to the merged list in ascending order.


5. code 

function merge(left, right) {
    let result = [];
    let i = 0;
    let j = 0;

    while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
        if (left[i] < right[j]) {
            result.push(left[i]);
            i++;
        } else {
            result.push(right[j]);
            j++;
        }
    }

    // Add any remaining elements
    result = result.concat(left.slice(i), right.slice(j));
    return result;
}

// Example
const leftDeck = [2, 5, 9];
const rightDeck = [1, 6, 8];
const sortedDeck = merge(leftDeck, rightDeck);
console.log(sortedDeck); // [1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9]
