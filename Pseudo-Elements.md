# Pseudo-Elements in CSS:

Pseudo-elements in CSS are used to style parts of an element's content. They are preceded by a double colon (::) and allow you to apply styles to elements that don't exist as separate HTML elements. Common pseudo-elements include ::before and ::after, which are often used to add decorative elements or content to a page without additional HTML markup.
