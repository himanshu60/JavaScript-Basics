# **DOM (Document Object Model):**

## Purpose:
- DOM is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents, providing a structured representation of web pages.
- It allows developers to access, manipulate, and modify the content, structure, and style of web documents dynamically.

## Scope:
- DOM represents the structure of a single web page, converting the HTML markup into a tree-like data structure (nodes).

## Examples:
- Accessing and modifying elements on a web page using JavaScript.
- Adding or removing HTML elements dynamically.
- Manipulating styles and attributes of elements.

## Extra Information:
- DOM is supported by all modern web browsers and is essential for building interactive web applications.

# **BOM (Browser Object Model):**

## Purpose:
- BOM is a programming interface that provides access to the browser window and its various features, beyond the scope of web documents.
- It allows interaction with the browser environment, managing browser-specific functionalities.

## Scope:
- BOM deals with browser-related objects and features like the window, location, history, and navigator.

## Examples:

- Managing browser history and navigation using the `history` object.
- Accessing browser information, such as the user's agent and platform, using the `navigator` object.
- Controlling browser windows and opening new tabs using the `window` object.

## Extra Information:
- The BOM is specific to each web browser and might have variations in functionality and support across different browsers.
- BOM is useful for tasks like manipulating browser behavior, handling user interactions, and controlling window properties.

## The BOM includes objects such as:

window: Represents the browser window and provides methods for interacting with it.
navigator: Contains information about the user's browser and operating system.
location: Provides information about the URL of the current web page and allows navigation to other URLs.
history: Allows manipulation of the browser's history, enabling backward and forward navigation.
screen: Provides information about the user's screen properties, like width, height, color depth, etc.
