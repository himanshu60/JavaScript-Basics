## View State:
1. View state is a feature in web development frameworks, like ASP.NET Web Forms, used to persist the state of controls (e.g., textboxes, checkboxes) between postbacks. It helps maintain the state of a web page, giving it the appearance of being stateful like a traditional desktop application.
2. The view state is automatically managed by the framework, storing control data in a hidden field on the page. It allows the page to retain user input and other state information across postbacks, making it easier to create interactive and dynamic web forms.

## Session State:
1. Session state is a mechanism used in web applications to store and retrieve user-specific data throughout a user's visit. It creates a unique session for each user and associates data with their session ID.
2. Session state is commonly used for maintaining user login status, user preferences, shopping cart items, and other user-specific information. It enables seamless user experiences across multiple pages or requests during a session on the website.
