JavaScript (JS) and Node.js are related but serve different purposes in the world of web development:

1. **JavaScript (JS):**
   
   - **Client-Side Language:** JavaScript is primarily a client-side scripting language used in web browsers to enhance the interactivity and functionality of web pages. It allows you to manipulate the DOM, respond to user actions, and perform various tasks on the client side.

   - **Front-End Development:** JS is commonly used for front-end web development to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is essential for tasks like form validation, animation, and making AJAX requests to load data from servers.

   - **Example:** When you use JavaScript to create a form validation script that checks if a user's input is valid before submitting a form on a website, you are using client-side JavaScript.

2. **Node.js:**
   
   - **Server-Side JavaScript Runtime:** Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine and provides a runtime for executing JavaScript outside of the web browser.

   - **Back-End Development:** Node.js is used for back-end web development, enabling developers to build server applications, APIs, and web servers using JavaScript. It's especially well-suited for building real-time applications and handling I/O-intensive tasks.

   - **Example:** When you create a server using Node.js to handle HTTP requests, route data, and interact with databases, you are using server-side JavaScript with Node.js.

In summary, JavaScript (JS) is primarily used on the client side to enhance web pages' interactivity, while Node.js is a server-side runtime environment that allows you to use JavaScript for building server applications. It's possible to use JavaScript both on the client and server sides of a web application, making it a versatile language for full-stack development. Developers often refer to the combination of JavaScript on the client and Node.js on the server as "full-stack JavaScript development."
