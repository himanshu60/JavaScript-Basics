In Python, "slicing" refers to the technique of extracting a portion (subsequence) of a data structure, such as a string, list, or tuple, by specifying a range of indices. Slicing allows you to create a new object containing a subset of the elements from the original data structure without modifying the original data.

The basic syntax for slicing is as follows:

```
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

- `sequence`: The data structure (e.g., string, list, tuple) from which you want to extract a slice.
- `start`: The index at which the slice begins (inclusive).
- `stop`: The index at which the slice ends (exclusive).
- `step` (optional): The step or stride between elements in the slice. It determines how many indices to skip between each selected element. If not specified, it defaults to `1`.

Here are some examples of slicing with different data structures:

**Slicing a String:**

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
substring = text[0:5]  # Get the first 5 characters
print(substring)  # Output: "Hello"

partial_string = text[7:]  # Get everything from index 7 to the end
print(partial_string)  # Output: "World!"
```

**Slicing a List:**

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
subset = my_list[1:4]  # Get elements at indices 1, 2, and 3
print(subset)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]

every_other = my_list[::2]  # Get every other element
print(every_other)  # Output: [1, 3, 5]
```

**Slicing a Tuple:**

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
portion = my_tuple[2:4]  # Get elements at indices 2 and 3
print(portion)  # Output: (30, 40)
```

Key points to remember about slicing in Python:

- The `start` index is inclusive (included in the slice), and the `stop` index is exclusive (not included in the slice).
- Slicing always produces a new object, leaving the original data structure unchanged.
- You can use negative indices to count from the end of the sequence, e.g., `my_list[-3:]` to get the last three elements.
- If you omit `start`, it defaults to the beginning of the sequence, and if you omit `stop`, it defaults to the end of the sequence.
- You can use slicing for strings, lists, tuples, and other sequence-like data structures in Python.
