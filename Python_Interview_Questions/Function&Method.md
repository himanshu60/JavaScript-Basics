In Python, both functions and methods are used to define reusable blocks of code, but there are key differences between the two:

**Function:**

1. **Independent**: A function is a self-contained block of code that can be defined at the module level (outside of any class) or within a module. It is not tied to any specific object or instance.

2. **Arguments**: Functions can take zero or more arguments as input and can return a value as output, using the `return` statement. The arguments are passed as parameters when the function is called.

3. **Definition**: Functions are defined using the `def` keyword followed by a function name and a set of parentheses for parameter names, and the code block is indented.

4. **Invocation**: Functions are called by their name followed by parentheses, e.g., `function_name(arguments)`.

**Method:**

1. **Belongs to an Object**: A method is a function that is associated with a specific object or instance of a class. It operates on the data and attributes of that object and can be considered a function that is bound to an object.

2. **Bound to Object**: Methods are defined within a class and operate on the instance variables and attributes of the class. They have access to the object using the `self` parameter, which refers to the instance itself.

3. **Definition**: Methods are defined within a class using the `def` keyword, and they take `self` as their first parameter (by convention). Other parameters can follow `self`.

4. **Invocation**: Methods are called on an instance of the class using the dot notation, e.g., `instance.method(arguments)`.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the difference:

```python
# Function example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")  # Calling the function
print(message)  # Output: "Hello, Alice!"

# Method example
class Greet:
    def greet(self, name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"

greeting_instance = Greet()  # Creating an instance of the class
message = greeting_instance.greet("Bob")  # Calling the method on the instance
print(message)  # Output: "Hello, Bob!"
```

In this example, `greet` is a function, while `greet` within the `Greet` class is a method. The function is independent and can be used without any association with an object, whereas the method operates within the context of an instance of the `Greet` class.
