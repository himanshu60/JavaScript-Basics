Python 2 and Python 3 are two major versions of the Python programming language. Python 3 was introduced to address various shortcomings and improve the language. As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, here are some key differences between Python 2 and Python 3:

1. Print Statement vs. Print Function:
   - Python 2: It uses the `print` statement, where you can print values like this: `print "Hello, World!"`.
   - Python 3: It uses the `print()` function, where you need parentheses to print values: `print("Hello, World!")`.

2. Integer Division:
   - Python 2: Integer division (`/`) between two integers truncates the decimal part, e.g., `5 / 2` results in `2`.
   - Python 3: Integer division (`//`) between two integers returns a float, e.g., `5 / 2` results in `2.5`.

3. Unicode Strings:
   - Python 2: Strings are ASCII by default, and Unicode strings require the `u` prefix, e.g., `u"Hello"`.
   - Python 3: Strings are Unicode by default, and the `u` prefix is no longer needed.

4. `xrange()` vs. `range()`:
   - Python 2: `xrange()` is more memory-efficient for iterating over large ranges.
   - Python 3: `xrange()` is removed, and `range()` is the only option. It behaves like Python 2's `xrange()` in terms of memory usage.

5. `input()` Function:
   - Python 2: `input()` evaluates the user's input as Python code.
   - Python 3: `input()` returns the user's input as a string. To get the behavior of Python 2's `input()`, use `eval(input())` in Python 3.

6. `print` as a Function:
   - Python 2: `print` is a statement and can be used without parentheses.
   - Python 3: `print` is a function and requires parentheses for use.

7. Division by Zero:
   - Python 2: Division by zero results in an integer zero, causing potential bugs.
   - Python 3: Division by zero raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception.

8. `__future__` Imports:
   - Python 2: You can use `from __future__ import print_function` and `from __future__ import division` to enable Python 3 behavior.
   - Python 3: These imports are not required as Python 3 uses these behaviors by default.

9. Unicode Handling:
   - Python 2: Unicode handling can be tricky, leading to "UnicodeDecodeError" or "UnicodeEncodeError" in some cases.
   - Python 3: Unicode handling is improved, and the default string type is Unicode.

10. Improved Iterators:
    - Python 3 introduced features like the `next()` function, `yield from`, and enhanced generator expressions, making iterators more powerful and efficient.

These are some of the fundamental differences between Python 2 and Python 3. It's important to note that Python 2 reached its end of life (EOL) on January 1, 2020, which means it no longer receives official support or updates. It is strongly recommended to use Python 3 for all new projects and to migrate existing Python 2 codebases to Python 3 to take advantage of its features and security improvements. Additionally, Python 3 has continued to evolve since my last knowledge update, so newer versions may have introduced additional changes and improvements.
