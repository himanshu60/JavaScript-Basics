Here are ten common Python interview questions along with their answers:

1. **What is Python?**
   - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

2. **Explain the differences between Python 2 and Python 3.**
   - Python 2 is an older version that is no longer supported. Python 3 is the current and recommended version. Key differences include print statements (Python 2: `print "Hello"`, Python 3: `print("Hello")`), division (Python 2: integer division by default, Python 3: float division by default), and Unicode support.

3. **What are the different data types in Python?**
   - Python supports various data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and more.

4. **How do you comment in Python?**
   - You can use the `#` symbol to add single-line comments. For multi-line comments, you can use triple-quotes (`'''` or `"""`) as a delimiter.

5. **What is a Python function, and how do you define one?**
   - A function is a reusable block of code. You can define a function using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and a colon. For example:
     ```python
     def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):
         # Function code here
     ```

6. **What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?**
   - Lists are mutable (can be modified after creation) and use square brackets `[ ]`. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation) and use parentheses `( )`.

7. **Explain the concept of Python decorators.**
   - Decorators are a powerful way to modify or enhance the behavior of functions or methods without changing their source code. They are often used for tasks like logging, authentication, and caching.

8. **What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python?**
   - The Global Interpreter Lock is a mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. It can limit the execution of multi-threaded Python programs, as only one thread can execute Python code simultaneously, but it doesn't affect multi-processing.

9. **What is the purpose of the `__init__` method in Python classes?**
   - The `__init__` method is a constructor in Python classes. It is called when a new object is created from the class and is used to initialize attributes and perform setup tasks.

10. **How can you handle exceptions in Python?**
    - Python uses the `try`, `except`, `finally` block for exception handling. You can use `try` to enclose code that might raise an exception and use `except` to specify how to handle the exception. The `finally` block is optional and is used to define cleanup code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurs.

These are just a few common Python interview questions, and the depth of questions may vary depending on the position and company you're interviewing with. Be sure to practice coding and problem-solving as well to showcase your practical skills during interviews.
