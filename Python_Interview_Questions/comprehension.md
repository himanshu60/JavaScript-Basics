List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python by applying an expression to each item in an iterable. It provides a compact and readable syntax for generating lists.

Example:
```python
# Create a list of squared numbers from 1 to 5 using list comprehension
squared_numbers = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
# Result: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

In this example, `squared_numbers` is created by applying the expression `x**2` to each element `x` in the range from 1 to 5.
