The rest and spread operators in JavaScript are both represented by three dots (`...`), but they have different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here are the key differences between the rest and spread operators in JavaScript:

**Rest Operator (`...`)**

1. **Purpose:** The rest operator is used in function parameters to collect multiple arguments into a single array-like object. It allows you to handle a variable number of function arguments as an array.

2. **Usage:** Typically, you'll find the rest operator in function declarations and function expressions within the parameter list. It collects the remaining arguments into an array.

3. **Example:**

   ```javascript
   function sum(...numbers) {
     return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
   }

   console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 10
   ```

4. **Context:** The rest operator is used within function parameters.

**Spread Operator (`...`)**

1. **Purpose:** The spread operator is used to spread (expand) elements from an array or object into another array or object. It is used to make copies, combine arrays, or create new objects with merged properties.

2. **Usage:** The spread operator can be used in various contexts, such as array literals, object literals, function arguments, and more.

3. **Examples:**

   - Combining arrays:

     ```javascript
     const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
     const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
     const combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // Creates a new array
     console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
     ```

   - Copying arrays:

     ```javascript
     const originalArray = [1, 2, 3];
     const copyArray = [...originalArray]; // Creates a new copy
     ```

   - Merging objects:

     ```javascript
     const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const obj2 = { b: 3, c: 4 };
     const mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // Creates a new object
     ```

4. **Context:** The spread operator is used in various contexts, such as array and object literals, function calls, and object merging.

In summary, the rest operator is used to collect function arguments into an array-like object, primarily within function parameters. The spread operator is used to spread elements from arrays or objects into other arrays or objects, and it can be used in a wide range of contexts. They have different use cases and are not interchangeable.
