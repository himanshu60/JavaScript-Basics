A pipeline, in a general sense, is a sequence of connected stages or steps through which something flows or progresses. In the context of technology and software development:

A "pipeline" often refers to a series of automated steps or processes that data, code, or work items go through, usually in a linear fashion. These steps are designed to achieve a specific goal, such as building and deploying software, testing, or data processing.

For example, a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline automates the steps involved in building, testing, and deploying software updates. Data pipelines might involve stages for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) to move and process data.

In essence, a pipeline in technology is like an assembly line that streamlines and automates tasks, ensuring efficiency and consistency in the workflow.
