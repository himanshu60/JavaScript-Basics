Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual parts, or "units," of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure they work correctly. These units typically consist of small, self-contained functions or methods within the code. The goal of unit testing is to validate that each unit of code functions as expected and produces the correct output when given specific inputs. It helps identify and fix bugs early in the development process, improving software quality and maintainability.
