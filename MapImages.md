# Storing and Retrieving Map Images in MongoDB:

1.To store map images in MongoDB, you can save them as binary data (e.g., in a Buffer) within a document, along with metadata like the map's name, location, or timestamp.
2. To retrieve map images, query the database to find the desired document and serve the binary data as a response.
