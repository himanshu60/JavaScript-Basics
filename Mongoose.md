# Mongoose

Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It simplifies working with MongoDB databases by providing a structured way to define data models, schema validation, and interactions with the database.

In simple terms, Mongoose helps you organize and manage your data when you're using MongoDB with Node.js. It makes it easier to create, retrieve, update, and delete data by providing a clear structure for your data models and how they should be stored in the database.
