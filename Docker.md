Docker is a technology that allows you to package and run applications and their dependencies in isolated, portable containers. These containers are like lightweight virtual machines that can run consistently across different environments, such as development laptops, servers, or cloud platforms. Docker simplifies application deployment and management by ensuring that everything needed to run an application is bundled together in a container, making it easier to move, share, and scale applications. It's commonly used in software development and deployment to ensure consistent and predictable environments for running applications.
