In JavaScript, both "undefined" and "null" are used to represent the absence of a value or the absence of an object, but they have slightly different meanings and use cases:

1. Undefined:
   - When a variable is declared but has not been assigned a value, it is automatically initialized to "undefined." For example:

     ```javascript
     let x;
     console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
     ```

   - When you try to access a property of an object that does not exist, JavaScript returns "undefined."

     ```javascript
     const obj = {};
     console.log(obj.property); // Outputs: undefined
     ```

   - Function parameters that are not provided with a value also have an "undefined" default value.

     ```javascript
     function foo(a) {
       console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined
     }
     foo();
     ```

2. Null:
   - Null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or a deliberate empty value.
   - It is often used to indicate that a variable or object property should have no value, as opposed to "undefined," which usually indicates that a variable hasn't been initialized.
   - It is explicitly assigned to a variable or property.

     ```javascript
     let y = null;
     console.log(y); // Outputs: null
     ```

   - Null is often used when you want to reset or clear a variable or object property.

     ```javascript
     let obj = { prop: "some value" };
     obj.prop = null; // Clear the property
     console.log(obj.prop); // Outputs: null
     ```

In summary, "undefined" typically represents the absence of an expected value due to a lack of initialization or the absence of an object property, while "null" represents the deliberate absence of a value or the intention to clear a variable or object property. It's important to be aware of these distinctions when working with JavaScript, as they can affect the behavior of your code.
