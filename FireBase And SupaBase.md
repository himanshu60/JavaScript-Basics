# Firebase and Supabase are both cloud-based platforms for building and managing web and mobile applications, but they have some differences:


## Firebase:
- Made by Google.
- Offers lots of services like databases, authentication, and hosting.
- Easy to use and good for real-time features.
- Has a free tier and paid plans.

## Supabase:
- Open-source alternative to Firebase.
- Focuses on PostgreSQL database and real-time features.
- Gives developers more control and can be self-hosted.
- Offers both a free open-source version and a paid hosted option.

In a nutshell, Firebase is a managed platform with many services, while Supabase is open-source, focusing on PostgreSQL and real-time features. Your choice depends on your project needs and preferences.
