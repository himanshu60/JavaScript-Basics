# In CSS, "positions" refer to the different ways an element can be positioned on a web page. There are several position properties available:

1. Static: The default position where elements follow their normal flow in the document.

2. Relative: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position. It allows you to use positioning properties like top, bottom, left, right to move the element from its original position.

3. Absolute: Elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor. If no positioned ancestor is found, it positions relative to the initial containing block (usually the document body).

4. Fixed: Elements are positioned relative to the viewport (browser window) and do not move even when the page is scrolled.

5. Sticky: Elements are positioned based on the user's scroll position. It acts like a combination of relative and fixed positioning, staying in its normal flow until a specified scroll threshold is reached.

Each position has its own behavior and can be used to achieve specific layout effects on a web page.
