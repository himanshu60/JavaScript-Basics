In JavaScript, the keyword "this" is like a pointer that refers to an object, and its role is to help you access properties and methods within that object. It can change its meaning depending on how and where it's used. Let's break it down with a simple example:

```javascript
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
};

console.log(person.fullName()); // Outputs "John Doe"
```

In this example:

1. We create an object called `person` with properties `firstName` and `lastName`, as well as a method `fullName`.

2. Inside the `fullName` method, we use the `this` keyword to access the `firstName` and `lastName` properties of the `person` object. So, `this.firstName` refers to "John," and `this.lastName` refers to "Doe."

3. When we call `person.fullName()`, it uses `this` to combine the first and last names and returns "John Doe."

The key point is that `this` in this context refers to the object (`person`) on which the method is called. It lets you work with the data inside that object without having to know the object's name explicitly. However, be aware that the behavior of `this` can change in different situations, such as when used in functions or event handlers, so it's essential to understand its context in your code.
