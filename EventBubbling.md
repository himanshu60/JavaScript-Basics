Event bubbling is a concept in JavaScript that describes how events, like mouse clicks or keyboard presses, are handled by elements in a web page's HTML hierarchy. In simple language, think of it like this:

Imagine you have a stack of nested bowls, one inside the other, like nesting dolls. Each bowl represents an HTML element on a web page. When you do something like clicking a button inside the innermost bowl, an event (like a click event) is generated.

Here's how event bubbling works:

1. **Event Generation:** When you click that button in the innermost bowl, a click event is created.

2. **Bubbling Up:** Instead of just stopping with the button, the event doesn't stay in one bowl. It "bubbles up" or "propagates" through the bowls, moving from the innermost bowl to the outer ones.

   - First, it triggers the click event for the button.
   - Then, it moves up to the next outer element (like a div containing the button) and triggers the click event for that.
   - It continues to move up the hierarchy, triggering the click event for each element it encounters.

3. **Event Handling:** At each step, you can have event handlers (functions) attached to these elements that respond to the event. These event handlers are executed as the event bubbles up through the hierarchy.

4. **Stopping Bubbling:** If an event handler decides that it's done with the event and wants to stop it from bubbling further up, it can use the `event.stopPropagation()` method. This means the event won't reach the outer elements.

So, event bubbling is like a ripple effect from the point where the event was triggered. It travels up through the nested elements, and each element can respond to the event if it has an event handler. It continues until an event handler stops it or until it reaches the top of the document (usually the `html` or `document` element).

Understanding event bubbling is important when working with complex web page structures or when you want to control how events are handled as they propagate through the DOM hierarchy.
