# Sharding in MongoDB is a way to distribute and manage large amounts of data across multiple servers or "shards" to improve scalability and performance.

## In simple terms:

Sharding helps MongoDB handle massive amounts of data by splitting it into smaller chunks.
Each chunk is stored on a separate server (shard), which allows for parallel processing and faster queries.
MongoDB's sharding mechanism automatically balances data distribution among shards.
For example, if you have a very large collection of customer data, sharding would divide that data across multiple servers, making it easier to handle and query the information efficiently.
